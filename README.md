## Developer Guide

This is very much a basic work in progress and it's been years since I've worked on it! Feel free to play with it or experiment.

This is pure HTML/JS, there are no frameworks used.

When a change is pushed to the `master` branch the GitHub Pages site will automatically be updated.
