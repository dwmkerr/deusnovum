The time indicator will be a circle with a smaller circle moving around it's circumference.
This will suggest movement, but in the future could be scratched or scrubbed with the mouse

The mouse wheel will be used to absorb or inject energy into the system, amount proportional to inverse
square of distance of point to mouse.

Supress the right mouse click handling.

Scrollbars goof the coordinates, just like the space invaders example.

Planet radius should be a function of the mass (cube root).
